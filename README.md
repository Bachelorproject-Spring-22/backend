# uniLeague

uniLeague is a way to improve your learning by actively participating in class. You collect points by answering quizzes and participating in class. uniLeague is a new way to keep track of your own learning results.

uniLeague is a bachelor project for the web development degree at NTNU GjÃ¸vik. Its task is to measure student engagement based on the usage of Kahoot! - an interactive quiz tool. The project's purpose is to find factors that determine if a student will be engaged by using Kahoot - or simply going through the lecture.

When designing uniLeague, we always aim to consider the environment. In fact, uniLeague is built with sustainability in mind. uniLeague is more environmentally friendly than 90% of other websites. Some of our happy green practices include a dark color palette and minimal use of fonts and symbols to reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as to display all essential information without loading multiple pages. ðŸŒ³
